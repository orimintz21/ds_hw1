Instructions:
redirect the input files (<) and output files (>)
you may use the following bash (linux) command if you want: (replace <executable> with your executable name)
	run all 100 tests with get:
		for i  in {0..99}; do <executable> < input_$i.txt > my_output_$i.txt ; done
	to check for diffs in output, you can then use:
		for i  in {0..99}; do diff -s -q --strip-trailing-cr out_$i.txt my_output_$i.txt ; done
	valgrind:
		for i  in {0..1}; do valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --num-callers=20 <executable> < tests/in$i.txt | grep "ERROR SUMMARY\|total heap usage\|in use at exit"; done
